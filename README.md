# Tarraform
Explain terraform concepts
Terraform state file: When we make changes into our configuration file and type terraform plan, terraform will also let us know that our statefile does not matches what is in our configuration file locally
If we make changes on aws console also, and type terraform plan, terraform will tell us that our current state does not matches our desired state
